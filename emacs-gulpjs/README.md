#gulpjs#

##Description##

This package offers a basic support of gulp, the javascript streaming
build system, for Emacs.

##Installation##

First, you should put the gulpjs directory in your load path:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to-gulpjs-dir>")
```

Then, you can either require the whole file in your *init.el*:

```elisp
(require 'gulpjs)
```

Or just put an autoload for the main entry point:

```elisp
(autoload 'gulpjs-start-task "gulpjs" "Start a gulp task." t)
```

##Usage##

When you are visiting a file in a project using gulp, simply use the
command `M-x gulpjs-start-task`, which will prompt you for the task to
start.  gulp process will be started, its output redirected to the
buffer named `*gulp*` by default.

You can restart a stopped process by either pressing *g* in the gulp
buffer, or using `M-x gulpjs-restart-task`.

##State of the project##

This package is a tiny code that I wrote to fit my specific and very
basic use of gulp. If you think some useful functionality could be
added, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/stevenremot/emacs-gulpjs/issues) so we can talk about it.

This code is released under the GPL v3. See *COPYING* for more
